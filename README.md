# Project Description
This is an [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/) project for bringing your own instance to Kaggle competitions. Users can use the Kaggle API to connect, download datasets from, and submit results to the Kaggle platform, providing a new way to seamlessly work locally on hardware of the user's choice, free from the limitations of cloud-based platforms like Google Colab and the Kaggle Kernel. 

| :warning: Heads Up             |
| :----------------------------- |
| This project is compatible with Kaggle competitions that are reachable for submission via the Kaggle API. This project will **not** submit properly for competition formats that restrict users to the platform for a balanced hardware allowance requirement (like the "code" competition format). More details [here](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/competitions#competition-formats). |

This project builds out a mirrored Kaggle environment and consists of the following notebooks to provide a seamless integration into the Kaggle competition platform:
* ``01-data.ipynb``: This notebook walks the user through downloading competition datasets directly from the Kaggle platform. Simply type the competition name and get started!
* ``02-code.ipynb``: This notebook walks through sample code for solving the end-to-end example competition started in ``01-data.ipynb`` and compiles a submission file.
* ``03-submit.ipynb``: This notebook submits your outputs to the Kaggle competition. See how you stack up on the leaderboard! 

In addition to providing a seamless local experience for working with Kaggle competitions, AI Workbench also provides the following to users:
* Easy version control and tracking of code via Github/Gitlab - say goodbye to manual versioning or CI/CD pipelines.
* Get the advantages of using a local, dedicated IDE: robust debugging, intelligent code completion, and downloadable extensions.
* Automatically set up and customize your local environment in minutes. 
* Plug into and access existing data sources locally without needing to upload them to third parties. 
* No Internet? No problem. Develop while offline!

| :memo: Remember             |
| :---------------------------|
| This project is meant as an example workflow and a starting point; you are free to swap out the example competition, add new datasets and models, rearrange the interface, or edit the source code as you see fit! |

# Quickstart

## Prerequisites
AI Workbench will prompt you to provide a few pieces of information before running any apps in this project. Ensure you have this information ready. 

   * A Kaggle Username. You can find this in ``kaggle.json`` when you click "Create New Token" [here](https://www.kaggle.com/settings).
   * A Kaggle API Key. You can find this in ``kaggle.json`` when you click "Create New Token" [here](https://www.kaggle.com/settings).

## Tutorial (Desktop App)

If you do not NVIDIA AI Workbench installed, first complete the installation for AI Workbench [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/). 

| :bulb: Tip              |
| :-----------------------|
| Working in the AI Workbench command-line interface (CLI)? Skip to the [next section](#tutorial-cli) for a CLI-only tutorial! |

Let's get started! 

1. Fork this Project to your own GitHub namespace and copy the link

   ```
   https://github.com/[your_namespace]/<project_name>
   ```
   
2. Open the NVIDIA AI Workbench App. Select a location to work in. 
   
3. Clone this Project onto your desired machine by selecting **Clone Project** and providing the GitHub link.
   
4. Wait for the project to build. You can expand the bottom **Building** indicator to view real-time build logs. 
   
5. When the build completes, set the following configurations.

   * `Environment` &rarr; `Secrets` &rarr; `Configure`. Specify the Kaggle Username and Kaggle API Key as project secrets.

6. On the top right of the AI Workbench window, select **Open Jupyterlab**. A frontend user interface should automatically open in a new browser tab.

7. Open ``kaggle/working/01-data.ipynb`` and get started. It's that easy!

## Tutorial (CLI)

Some users may choose to use the **CLI tool only** instead of the Desktop App. If you do not NVIDIA AI Workbench installed, first complete the installation for AI Workbench [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/). Then, 
1. Fork this Project to your own GitHub namespace and copying the link

   ```
   https://github.com/[your_namespace]/<project_name>
   ```
   
2. Open a shell and activating the Context you want to clone into by

   ```
   $ nvwb list contexts
   
   $ nvwb activate <desired_context>
   ```

   | :bulb: Tip                  |
   | :---------------------------|
   | Use ```nvwb help``` to see a full list of  AI Workbench commands. |
   
3. Clone this Project onto your desired machine by running

   ```
   $ nvwb clone project <your_project_link>
   ```
   
4. Open the Project by

   ```
   $ nvwb list projects
   
   $ nvwb open <project_name>
   ```

5. Start **Open Jupyterlab** by

   ```
   $ nvwb start jupyterlab
   ```

   * Specify the Kaggle Username and Kaggle API Key as project secrets.

6. A frontend user interface should automatically open in a new browser tab. 

7. Open ``kaggle/working/01-data.ipynb`` and get started. It's that easy!
